# Schulich Innovations and Recognition

This is a conversion of a [PowerPoint presentation](https://github.com/mbdata/schulich_achievements/blob/master/data/Schulich%20Achievements%201988%20to%202014.pptx) to various time-series charts.
The following work was done:

1) The PPT file was scanned for information and converted to a comma separated file (https://github.com/mbdata/schulich_achievements/blob/master/data/schulich_achievements.csv)

2) Spotfire presentation containing two charts, presenting a timeline of the total number of achievements and achievements per category:

3) Python exercise with instructions on creating the same visualizations, with an additional stacked area chart presenting the total number of achievements (not available in Spotfire):
